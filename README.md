# FastAPI Streaming Backend

Welcome to the FastAPI Streaming Backend! This repository contains the backend code for the streaming application, built using the FastAPI framework and integrated with Mux for efficient video streaming.

## Features

- **Streaming Capabilities**: Utilize Mux's powerful video streaming capabilities to deliver high-quality video content to users.
- **RESTful API**: Develop a RESTful API with FastAPI for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Async Support**: Leverage asynchronous programming to handle high loads and concurrent video streams efficiently.
- **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to protect streaming endpoints and user data.
- **Database Integration**: Integrate with your preferred database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) using ORMs like SQLAlchemy or SQLModel.
- **Documentation**: Automatically generate interactive API documentation with Swagger UI or ReDoc.
